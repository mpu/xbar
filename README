xbar - Minimalistic monitoring for X11.

License: MIT/X (See LICENSE).

xbar is intended to be a very light resource monitoring tool. Up to
know, it seems to be the case.

xbar is xmobar[1] without "mo". xmobar is a great tool but I found it
too expensive to run, it consumes a lot of memory and spends too much
cpu time. However it is a high level tool and can be easily extended.

xbar keeps the modular design of xmobar but does not do many
abstractions to stay near the bare metal. It is written in C, thus it
has an extensive control of all resources and try to minimize their
usage. xmobar plugins are now called "modules" and can be written in
an easy way without knowing too much of xbar internals (see for
instance mod_say.c).

xbar, as xmonad[2], dwm[3], and a bunch of other high quality programs
is customized via editing its source code. However, don't be afraid,
you will only have to modify one source file (config.h) and the
preprocessor makes it easy.

xbar is still experimental and has several problems, it is not yet as
mature as xmobar; there is no colors support, no utf8 support and many
"modules" have to be written. Moreover, it is not yet guaranteed to be
portable.

If you create a module, or add an extra feature, I will be glad to
merge your code inside xbar.
